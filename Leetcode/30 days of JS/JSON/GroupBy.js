// Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array. A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array which generate that key. The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key. The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.





Array.prototype.groupBy = function(fn) {
    const ans = {}
    for(let e of this){
        const key = fn((e))
        ans[key] ||=[]
        ans[key].push(e)
    }
    return ans
};
